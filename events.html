        <p>out there, beyond the mountains, hidden in the peninsula, where the surf roars and the baboons reign, where ostrich and horses run, Way Out There where the wild things are lies a break from the bustle.  



            Join us Way Out There, for a day of a curated collection of art, visceral culture and live music at the beautiful and prestigous Cape Farmhouse.

        <p>We would love for you to join us at our first moment together as Common Ground Rondebosch! Bring your blankets/ chairs and picnic food as we gather together to celebrate God's goodness and faithfulness as a new family. There will be live music, fun games to play, activities for the kids, a few treats for sale, and more! 



            Because of the uncertainty of the weather, we have decided to host the event in our venue parking area.</p>
